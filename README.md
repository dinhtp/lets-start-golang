# Let's Start Golang


## What to do
First thing first, let's learn some coding with Golang. \
This repository is a complete beginner tutorial of Golang which helps you learn the basic 
The repository divided into multiple sub directories, each directory will represent a tutorial of Golang.
Each tutorial provided with a number of different learning resources to cover lesson as much as possible.
There will be exercises with in each tutorial where you can practice coding and test out the result. 

## How to use
### Learning resource
The learning resource of each tutorial provided in the comment block which denoted by the **@Resource** notation
As the first rule of thumb, you should always read from the top to the bottom. The last resource items will cover a wider 
range of knowledge from the topic that may require basic understanding from the first items.

### Coding practice
While going over the learning resources, you can practice coding inside the **main** function of the `main.go` file.
There are many **TODO** notations that can help you check your understanding and guide you through the coding practice.

### Code testing
In order to execute the code to test the result, simply open the directory in the terminal and execute `go run main.go`.
For example, to test the code with in the **01.Intro** directory, open the terminal and navigate to the **01.Intro** directory.
The terminal will appear somewhat as follows:
```
{prefix_path}/01.Intro$ go run main.go
```
